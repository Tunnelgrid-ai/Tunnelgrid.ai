## Technical Architecture

### Service Factory Pattern
```python
class LLMServiceFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_service(service_type: LLMServiceType) -> BaseLLMService:
        if service_type == LLMServiceType.OPENAI:
            return OpenAIService()
        elif service_type == LLMServiceType.PERPLEXITY:
            return PerplexityService()
        elif service_type == LLMServiceType.GEMINI:
            return GeminiService()
```

### Concurrent Analysis Orchestration
```python
class AnalysisOrchestrator:
    async def run_multi_service_analysis(
        self, 
        audit_id: str, 
        services: List[LLMServiceType]
    ) -> AnalysisResults:
        # Execute analysis across all services concurrently
        # Track individual service progress
        # Aggregate and combine results
```

## API Changes

### Updated Endpoints

#### 1. Analysis Job Creation
```json
POST /api/analysis/start
{
    "audit_id": "uuid",
    "services": ["openai", "perplexity", "gemini"]
}
```

#### 2. Enhanced Job Status Response
```json
GET /api/analysis/status/{job_id}
{
    "job_id": "uuid",
    "status": "running",
    "progress_percentage": 65.5,
    "service_statuses": [
        {
            "service": "openai",
            "status": "completed",
            "progress_percentage": 100.0,
            "completed_queries": 50,
            "total_queries": 50
        },
        {
            "service": "perplexity",
            "status": "running",
            "progress_percentage": 30.0,
            "completed_queries": 15,
            "total_queries": 50
        }
    ]
}
```
