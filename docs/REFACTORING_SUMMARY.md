│   ├── backend/              # Backend-specific tests
│   ├── frontend/             # Frontend-specific tests
│   ├── integration/          # Full-stack tests
│   ├── api/                  # API endpoint tests
│   ├── unit/                 # Unit tests
│   └── data/                 # Test data and fixtures
├── docs/                     # Comprehensive documentation
├── scripts/                  # Utility scripts
├── backend/                  # Clean backend structure
├── frontend/                 # Clean frontend structure
└── Configuration files at root level
```
